# FAQ - Frequently asked questions

## How do I nest pairs?

> You may combine piles.

- And how do I combine piles?

> Well, use a construction which is named after RenÃ¨ Descartes (a French Professor) whose formulation of analytic geometry gave rise to the concept.

- So, what's the construction?

> It's called a _Cartesian product_ (or _cross product_) - constructs a product set.
>
> All, that is - each and every `Pair` which has one side from here and one from there.

- Ahh! I see.

> And -as it's used very often in here- we shortnamed it `X()`

- I love short names!

> Try `pp := profs.X(profs)`

- Ahh! _pp_ is short for _Pairs of Professors_, is it not?

> If You say so... And: You do love short names, do You not?

- Yes, I do. I love short names!

> That's it. So, how many will be there?

- Hm. We started with 4, added another one, so we have 5.
  
  And 5 * 5 is twentyfive. There's 25 pairs in `pp`, is it not?

> Well, Yes - and No.
>
> Yes, if You go thru the `pp`s You'll see all 25.
>  
> And No - they do not exist, at least not all at the same time in Your computers memory.

- Ugh? How comes? And were are they hiding?

> Well - such products and products of products and products of products of products...
>
> They tend to grow - very quickly, very fast- and become very large.
>
> Thus: No point to waste precious memory.

- Okay ... so `pp` is not another pile?

  But then: what is it?

> Happy You ask! It's called a `Tail`. A facility to go thru the construction and get each member on demand - on the fly, so to say.
